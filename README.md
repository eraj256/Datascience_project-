IRIS Dataset Analysis Project
Description
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the famous Iris Dataset using various data science techniques.
Key highlights of the project include:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand feature distributions and relationships.
Correlation Matrix: Checked the direct correlation of each feature with the target variable.
Model Building: Built a classification model and evaluated its performance.
Confusion Matrix: Used to assess the modelâ€™s predictions.
Accuracy Check:
Training Accuracy: 96%
Testing Accuracy: 100%
The high accuracy is justified by the nature of the dataset:
The Iris Dataset is clean and well-structured.
It contains no null or missing values, which significantly contributed to the model's performance.
This project serves as a solid example of performing end-to-end data analysis, model building, and evaluation on a clean real-world dataset.
