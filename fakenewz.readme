# ðŸ“° Fake News Classification using NLP

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project is part of an internship task where we designed a **Fake News Detection System** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The system classifies news articles as either **REAL** or **FAKE**, helping to combat misinformation on digital platforms.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): class distribution and article length analysis.  
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.  
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve.  
- Real-world testing with new unseen articles.

 ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Fake and Real News Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets/code")  

It includes two CSV files:  
- **Fake.csv** â†’ Fake news articles  
- **True.csv** â†’ Real news articles  

---

ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with AUC â‰ˆ 0.9.  
- Successfully detected both **fake** and **real** test news articles outside the dataset.  

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Numpy  
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
The project demonstrates how **NLP + Machine Learning** can be applied to detect misinformation.  
This solution can be scaled for **media companies, governments, and social media platforms** to ensure trust and credibility.
